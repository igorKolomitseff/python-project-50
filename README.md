The GENDIFF is the second educational project in the training program "Python developer" on the [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io).

The GENDIFF (GENerator of DIFFerences) is a CLI program that compares two configuration files in JSON or YAML formats and represents the difference between files in the following formats:
- stylish (default)
- plain
- json

The program is installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) by the following command:
```
python3 -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/igorKolomitseff/python-project-50.git
```
